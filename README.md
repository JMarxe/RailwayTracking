This project is a railway tracking system that allows users to obtain relevant information about train timing, whether it is on time or running late, what is the arrival time in a particular station, and so on. The system can track the time of departure of a train from a station and forward this information to the upcoming stations.

If the system identifies a delay in the departure of a train from a particular station, it will pass the information on to the next stations. This project delivers real-time train schedule events to multiple subscribing client applications.

This tracking system consists of an Admin module. The Admin enters all the relevant details about trains and their arrival timing on different stations, which is then forwarded to the next station via an Internet server. Usually, the Admins add information such as the train departed from a station, expected arrival at the next destination, delay in the train schedule, etc.

Once the upcoming station receives this data, it will automatically select the data associated with that station and display the same on the screen for the users to see. So, if the Admin at Miami Airport station enters information specific to a Tri Rail station, only the Tri Rail station system will display that information. The station managers at every station have unique login IDs using which they can update the train arrival time at their station.

The Tracking Trainz application will allow users to login into the app with their own unique credentials which they have created themselves. The app will also have a system to let the passenger know if what they have entered is the correct login information. As well as having a system that lets them know when their credentials are incorrect, the application will display an error message if that is the case. Once the passenger's logged in they will have full access to use the application. The passenger will be able to view their account and book a train ticket to get to where they need to go.

The passenger will be able to make a secure payment through the app to book a ticket. Next there will be a system to verify the funds from the customer's bank account. Once funds have been verified and received then the customer will then be able to generate their train ticket. The customer will always retrieve access to their ticket all in their account on the app.

**Train Management** is the system that receives the train path request approved by the **Train Station Admins** in order to perform the different routes of the day. This train path form has the train route based on the identification of the train path, departure station, date and time of departure, and the destination station. After the confirmation and reservation, they also receive an analysis of traffic conditions of the day, and to ensure the performance of the operation; shift plans are considered to prevent any issue in case of an unexpected scenario. After that, they give the instructions to the carrier who will perform the process and lead the assembly, preparing the train departure. He is also in charge of sending the disclosure of departure information to update the **Railway Tracking System data**.

The **Booking Management** are in charge of the process where all the customers' requests go to a booking engine that checks and compares the availability of seats and trains of a specific route in order to show the schedule and price of it. After the book is done, every customer gets a confirmation and receives a confirmation number generated by the **Ticket Management** , which allows them to be able to track the information like seat number, train number, path number, initial station, date and time of departure, destination expected date and time of arrival.

Once the **railway**  **sens**** or** has communicated to the railway tracking system a train's new position, it will then relay information to the passengers waiting at stations, via the terminal screens on the walls. Also, the information will also be accurately updated on the respected train stations app. The information that will be updated and shown include Train updates, Booking Updates, Ticket Updates, Route and Updates.

**Train Updates** tell the passengers where the train's current location is, its estimated time of arrival to the station and other basic information like train speed, amenities (leather seats, wifi, meals, etc). **Booking Updates** show the most accurate prices for tickets based on the train's current location. **Ticket Updates** also allows users to see which seats are available, including luxury seating. This is especially helpful for passengers traveling together who want to get seats next to each other. Finally, **Route Updates** show the users what rails the train will be taking, what cities and other major landmarks the train will be passing and what stations it will be stopping at along the way. Route updates also show the passengers the estimated time it will take to get to each of the locations the train will be passing through.
 All these updates happen in real time thanks to the **Railway Sensors** placed in various locations along all the train routes. These ensure customers and passengers are getting the most accurate information available, for a pleasant and seamless experience.

The **Amtrak, TriRail, MIA Transit,** and **Metrolink** are transit transportations all throughout Miami. They all use a railway tracking system that has sensors all throughout the train and railroads. Each sensor senses the train which plays a role with route management, this indicates what routes are part of which transit system. Factors of this include where the trains stop and how many stops there will be. Additionally, it controls which trains have access to specific tracks and when. The **Route Management** connects to the tracking system which essentially lets passengers know whether the train is on time or delayed, and how many stops are left until reaching your destination. A set time is estimated between each station. Throughout the track of each station, the sensors catch up on the signals and state the trains' locations.

This ties to all the system updates that includes generating train, booking, route, and ticket updates. All of this then gets displayed in A Display Data. Essentially, it lets passengers know which service is operating to let passengers ahead of time its route, destination, and estimated time of arrival. If there are incidents and vehicles are stopped there would be an advisory notice displayed. This eventually leads to taking a different route in the case of trying to re-route to the final destination. Using a display data analysis and updates eases a customer's/passenger's journey according to their plans and they can take into consideration how much time in total their trip could be.

An example of this would be at Los Angeles Union Station where there are screens of displays that show where each route is located in each track, how much time it takes, and the time for them to be at that specific destination. For example, one of the specific displays has information that indicates each track is for specific train lines and at what time they will depart.
